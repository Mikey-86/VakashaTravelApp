VakashaTravelApp
An Android app that allows users to store and view trips on their travelling wish list.

This was a group project for my open source module in which my group had to create an adroid application that allows the user to store items and goals they want to achieve in the application.
We decided to create a travelling collection app, according to the brief.

My role in the project was intially the UI mockup and elements, then developing the addition of new trips to collections and finally assisting in the compilation and recordings of the application.

Video demonstration of all the functionalities of the application:
